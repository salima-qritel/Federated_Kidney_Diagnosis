# Federated Kidney Diagnosis 

A Federated Learning system for early diagnosis of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) using Flower, Docker, Prometheus, and Grafana.

## 🚀 Overview

This project implements a federated learning architecture to detect chronic kidney disease early using a distributed dataset. It simulates multiple clients (e.g., hospitals or labs) that collaboratively train a model **without sharing raw patient data**.

Key technologies:

* 🧠 **Flower** (FL framework)
* 🐍 **Scikit-learn** & **MLPClassifier** for the model
* 🐳 **Docker** & `docker-compose` for orchestration
* 📊 **Prometheus & Grafana** for monitoring and visualization

## ⚙️ How It Works

* **Each client** loads its own version of the CKD dataset and trains a model locally.
* **The server** coordinates training rounds using **FedAvg** aggregation.
* **Prometheus** collects metrics from clients and server.
* **Grafana** visualizes the system's performance and metrics in real-time.

## 🧪 Installation & Usage

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/OumaimaTF/federated-kidney-diagnosis.git
cd federated-kidney-diagnosis
```

### 2. Build and run the system

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

> All components (server, clients, Prometheus, Grafana) will start in isolated containers.

### 3. Access dashboards

* 📈 Prometheus: [http://localhost:9090](http://localhost:9090)
* 📋 Grafana: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

  * Login: `admin` / `admin`

## 🧭 Execution Plan

This is a brief overview of how the system runs:

1. **Infrastructure Startup** via Docker Compose:
   - Starts the Flower server
   - Launches two FL clients simulating medical centers
   - Starts Prometheus, Grafana, and Pushgateway for monitoring

2. **Federated Learning Setup**:
   - Each client registers with the server
   - The server orchestrates training rounds using the FedAvg aggregation algorithm

3. **Local Training & Aggregation**:
   - Each client trains an `MLPClassifier` on its local CKD dataset
   - Model weights are sent to the server for aggregation

4. **Metrics Monitoring**:
   - Clients and server push custom training metrics via Prometheus Pushgateway
   - Grafana visualizes metrics like accuracy, loss, and round number in real time

5. **Shutting Down**:
   - To gracefully stop all containers:
     ```bash
     docker-compose down
     ```
